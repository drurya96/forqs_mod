# This example is a simulation of selection at a single locus with additive
# fitness effects.  

# Ten isolated populations (each with 100 individuals) are simulated in
# parallel (no migration) for 120 generations.  Individuals have a single pair
# of chromosomes (chromosome_pair_count = 1).

# RecombinationPositionGenerator_SingleCrossover specifies that a single crossover
# event occurs per chromosome per generation, with equal probabilities of a
# gamete receiving one of the two parental copies or one of the two reciprocal
# recombinants, resulting in a recombination fraction of 1/2.  The
# recombination position is chosen uniformly at random between 0 and the
# specified chromosome lentgh.

# VariantIndicators are used to map variant values to haplotype chunk ids.
# VariantIndicator_SingleLocusHardyWeinberg specifies 0/1 variant values, at a
# specified allele frequency (for allele 1) within the population.  If N is the
# population size and p (= 1-q) is the allele frequency, the first N * p^2
# individuals are homozygous for allele 1, and next N*2pq individuals are
# heterozygous, and the remaining individuals are homozygous for allele 0.

# 1.1 is assigned to heterozygotes, and 1.2 is assigned to homozygotes for
# allele 1.
