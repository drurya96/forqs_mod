# 
# This simulation has 1000 diploid individuals, so they have haplotype ids
# 0-1999.
#
# The individuals have a single chromosome (chromosome == 1) that is
# 10 MB long.  Note that the length of the chromosome doesn't affect the
# performance of the simulation, but is used for recombination and by
# Reporter_HaplotypeFrequencies.
#
# A single quantitative trait is defined with two qtls (locus1, locus2), both
# with additive effect .1 on fitness.  The individuals are grouped into 4
# groups of equal size (250 individuals, 500 haplotype ids).  The first group
# (group 1) has variant (SNP) value 1 at locus1, and the last group (group 4)
# has variant value 1 at locus2.  All other variant values are 0.
#
# The haplotype frequency output (haplotype_frequencies_*_pop0.txt) show the
# local haplotype frequencies (i.e. local ancestry) moving toward 100% group 1
# near locus1 and toward 100% group 4 near locus2.  Note that in the region at
# the middle of the chromosome the proportions are near .25, as would be
# expected due to recombination.  One can also see that the mean fitnesses
# (mean_fitnesses.txt) rise steadily to 1.4, i.e. all individuals are fixed for
# variant 1 at both locus1 and locus2.
